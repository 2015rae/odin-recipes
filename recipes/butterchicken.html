    <p>These garlic butter chicken cutlets cook quickly on the stovetop, creating a nice garlicky pan sauce in the process. They're a versatile main dish for nights when time is limited.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
   <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
   <li>3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
   <li>2 teaspoons dried Italian herb seasoning</li>
   <li>6 (4 ounce) chicken breast cutlets</li>
   <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
   <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
   <li>1 1/2 tablespoons minced fresh garlic</li>
   <li>1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth</li>
   <li>Fresh parsley, for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
   <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
   <li>Stir salt, black pepper, and Italian seasoning together in a small bowl.</li>
   <li>Pat each cutlet dry with paper towels. If cutlets are thick on one end, lightly pound thicker parts for more even cooking. Sprinkle cutlets on both sides with the seasoning mixture.</li>
   <li>Heat oil and butter together in a large skillet over medium-high heat until oil is hot and butter is melted. Reduce heat to medium if needed.</li>
   <li>Place cutlets into the skillet in a single layer, working in batches if necessary, and cook until browned on both sides, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove chicken to a plate and keep warm.</li>
   <li>Add garlic to the same skillet and stir, scraping up any browned bits. Cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in chicken broth and bring to a boil, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
   <li>Return chicken and any accumulated juices to the skillet, turning to coat in the sauce. Cook until chicken is no longer pink and reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C).</li>
   <li>Remove chicken to a serving platter. Simmer pan juices until slightly reduced, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour sauce over chicken and garnish with fresh parsley.</li>
    </ol>

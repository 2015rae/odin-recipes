    <p>This eggnog dump cake could not be easier! It uses the classic 3-ingredient formula for dump cakes—perfect for popping in the oven at a moment's notice! Cake mix, eggnog, and butter are all you need. Serve with whipped topping or ice cream for the perfect finish.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>3 cups eggnog</li>   
     <li>1 box white or yellow cake mix</li>
     <li>1/2 cup butter, cut into small pieces</li>
     <li>whipped topping, for serving (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>    
    <li>Pour 1/3 of the eggnog into the prepared dish. Sprinkle cake mix evenly over eggnog. Pour remaining eggnog evenly over the top of cake mix. No need to stir!</li>
    <li>Distribute pieces of butter evenly on top.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and bubbly, 45 to 50 minutes.</li>
    <li>Allow dump cake to cool for 15 minutes before serving to allow the cake to set slightly. Serve with cool whip, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
